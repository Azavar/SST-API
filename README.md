# SST-API
Streamlined Sales Tax developer API
---

This repository is the home for the Streamlined Sales Tax SDK where developers can view and test sample code for interacting with the SST website API.

There are 2 applications: Web Service Tool and Web Service Sample Code.
* If you only want to test the SST API then the Web Service Tool makes it easy for you to construct valid messages and inspect the results.
* If you want to write a .Net application in C# to automate or integrate the API into some other software and want to see sample code of how to get started then you will be interested in the Web Service Sample Code.
