# Web Service Tool (For Service Providers)


In order to help service providers testing [BulkRegistration](https://github.com/azavar/SST-API/blob/master/Bulk%20Registration%20ReadMe.md), we created a tool to make it easier to build the bulk registration transmission using a visual editor.

## Features

- Visually build a Bulk Registraion transmission
- Load a Bulk Registraion transmission from XML file
- Save a Bulk Registraion transmission to XML file
- Submit a Bulk Registraion transmission to staging server (credentials are needed)
- View response in a user-friendly UI
- Save response to XML file

### Sample files
XML sample files are provided in the subfolder `Sample XML`

### Note
Both files (WebService Tester.exe and WebService Tester.exe.config) should be in the same directory for the tool to work.
